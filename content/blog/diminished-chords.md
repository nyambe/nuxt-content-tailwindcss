# Diminished Chords

> Each Monday Tony([@CountBlisset](https://www.youtube.com/c/CountBlissett) ) gives a lesson on some aspect of Music Theory.

> Then, we each submit our composition based on the lesson of the week. On each Saturday at 4pm Madrid Time, Tony reviews each song in a marathon live stream. Deadlines for submisions are at Saturday 2pm Madrid time. Compositions must be created specifically for these practical lesson

> Doing these lessons each week has leaped my Music Theory Chops further than I ever thought.

[This week the lesson was on Diminished Chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mu2dduRQEc)
