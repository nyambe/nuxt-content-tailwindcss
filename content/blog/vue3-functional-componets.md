# Functional Components

Functional Components are an alternative way of rendering vue content on you application. It is particulary useful when there is a lot of logic involved in the component and simple if-else logic wont resolve it. For example when createting a textComponent that can do h1,h2.... and dynamic classes

## What, when, how

Vue recommends using templates to build applications in the vast majority of cases. However, there are situations where we need the full programmatic power of JavaScript. That's where we can use the render function.[Vue 3 Render Functions & JSX](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function.html)
